            Through his life, Rahul Gandhi has always been the strongest
            proponent of politics of purpose. Over the years, he has lent his
            voice to a number of issues but has always remained focused on
            propagating non-violence, equality and justice. He has imbibed these
            virtues through a lifelong tryst with Indian politics and history
            and has developed a keen understanding of the Indian social fabric.
            Having experienced the pain of losing both his father and
            grandmother to acts of violence and hatred, Rahul Gandhi&nbsp; has
            always been a champion of Gandhian philosophies of ahimsa and truth.

            Born on 19 June 1970, Rahul Gandhi spent his early childhood between
            Delhi, the political center of India, and Dehradun, a town nestled
            in the valley between the Himalayas and Shivaliks. He began his
            undergraduate career at Delhi’s St. Stephen’s College before moving
            to Harvard University in the USA. In his second year, Rahul
            transferred to Rollins College in Florida due to security threats
            following his father’s, the late Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi’s,
            assassination. Rahul Gandhi graduated with a Bachelor’s degree in
            1994. The year after, he obtained his M. Phil from Trinity College,
            Cambridge.

            Rahul began his professional career with the Monitor Group, a
            management consulting firm based out of London - he was adamant on
            creating a professional career before joining politics. He soon
            returned to India and set up his own technology consultancy in
            Mumbai, where he led his team as the Director. The influence of his
            work in the management and technology sector is apparent in his
            political leanings. Rahul has always been a strong proponent of
            harnessing the scale and dexterity that technology can lend while
            amplifying the power of India’s greatest asset — her citizens.

            The call to serve our nation and to be an instrumental part of her
            growth came to Rahul Gandhi in 2004. He chose to stand from his
            father’s constituency and continue the legacy of serving the people
            of Amethi in Uttar Pradesh.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            Rahul won his first election with an overwhelming margin of 2,90,853
            votes — a testament to the faith placed by the people of his
            constituency in him. From the beginning, it was apparent that Rahul
            believed that our nation’s future lies with her people. Through the
            ebbs and flows of a decade-long political career, Rahul has held
            true to the very principles that won him the hearts of the people in
            his very first election.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            In 2013, Rahul Gandhi was elected as the Vice-President of the
            Congress Party. Within the Congress party, Rahul Gandhi played the
            key role of channeling the party along the lines of Congress’ core
            principles. He tirelessly worked to democratise the student wing and
            youth wing of the Congress party and ensured a breath of fresh air
            entered the grand old party by encouraging young leaders to take up
            leadership positions. His pivotal role in shaping the party along
            Congress’ core values over his political career earned him the post
            of President of the Congress Party in 2017. Under Rahul Gandhi’s
            guidance, the Congress Party has once again emerged as the voice of
            the nation.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            While he was President of the Opposition party, Rahul Gandhi played
            a key role in raising the demands of various stakeholders of the
            country. He championed the rights of the poor &amp; the
            marginalised. He led the battle against the ruling government on
            poorly implemented policies such as Demonetisation, Aadhar, GST and
            more.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            The vision of Rahul Gandhi and his strategy to fight the democratic
            battle with love and unity is what makes the Congress Party the true
            representative of a united India. Going forward, he aims to put
            these principles into action by creating systems that provide
            India’s citizens with the tools and opportunities they need to reach
            their full potential.

            In his current role as a Member of Parliament in the 17th Lok Sabha,
            he represents the constituency of Wayanad in Kerala. After leaving
            his position as President of the Congress party, he has put all his
            focus &amp; energy in representing the people of Wayanad &amp;
            taking on the government on a number of issues, like the
            undemocratic abrogation of Article 370 &amp; the violation of human
            rights by the government in Kashmir. He remains steadfast in his
            quest for truth, peace &amp; harmony for the people of India.
