            Education has been one of the core areas of focus for Rahul Gandhi.
            His ardent belief in universal education has constantly motivated
            him to transform Amethi into an education hub. His initiatives and
            endeavour to provide accessible quality education, especially higher
            education for the people of his constituency have considerably
            changed the face of education in Amethi.

            The Congress President, in his three term tenure, has established
            five institutes of higher education which have now become centres of
            excellence, attracting students from across the country. The
            district also has a chain of government run primary schools which
            implement schemes related to universal education for children
            through Right to Education and Mid Day Meals. A few decades ago,
            Amethi lacked even the basic public infrastructure for education of
            its students. Today, the progress is visible in the increasing
            number of educational institutes and better human development
            indicators in the district. There are 1716 primary schools and 437
            secondary schools which cater to the students of Amethi and five
            institutes of higher education which attract students from across
            the country. This development has also encouraged considerable
            private investment in the field of education. There are almost 40
            private degree colleges providing higher education to the students
            of Amethi. Due to the continuous endeavours of Rahul Gandhi, today
            the literacy rate of Amethi is 69.72% which is at par with the rest
            of UP.

              Apart from the government primary schools, a Sainik school is also
              under construction for the students of Amethi. Sainik schools were
              conceived to prepare students for entry into the National Defence
              Academy (NDA) and Indian Naval Academy. Since students from this
              school are offered direct admission to the NDA and Naval Academy,
              a Sainik school enables the youth of Amethi to enter the Armed
              Forces.

                The FDDI also has a training and operative centre which provides

                finishing and labs with state of the art machines. It was set up
                as a part of a scheme initiated by then Prime Minister Manmohan
                Singh to promote vocational training and boost employment.
                Through this scheme, the youth of Amethi are now able to afford
                specialised training and are given access to skills which boost
                their overall employability. The workshop guarantees almost 100%
                placement for its students apart from awarding them Rs 1500
                during the course of their training under the scheme.

                RGNAU set up in 2013 by Rahul Gandhi, is India&apos;s first aviation
                university. It facilitates and promotes aviation studies,
                teaching, training and research. The university will offer a
                number of courses aimed at bridging the skill gap within the
                Indian Aviation industry by producing trained pilots as per the
                future requirements of the industry. It also aims to work in
                conjunction with the industry to achieve excellence in
                operations and management of all the sub-sectors within the
                aviation industry. The university has signed an MoU with GMR
                Aviation Academy to jointly organise an employability oriented
                programme in Aviation/ Airport Operations focused at providing
                trained manpower to the industry, enabling students across the
                country and especially from Amethi to enter into the aviation
                industry directly. While construction of the institute has been
                completed, it is still not functional due to the delay in
                sanctioning by the BJP government in the state and Centre.

                The CRPF Training Centre was set up in 2013 with a Rs. 320 crore
                investment to provide training to paramilitary forces with
                modern facilities and training centres. The centre has the
                capacity to train nearly 1,000 fresh recruits who join the
                country&apos;s largest central security force as constables. The
                setting up of the training centre in Amethi, which is amongst
                the only eight CRPF training centres across the country, has
                encouraged more youth of Amethi to join the police force.
