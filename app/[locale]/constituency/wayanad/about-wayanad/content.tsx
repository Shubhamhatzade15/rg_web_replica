            Wayanad is one of the most demographically diverse parliamentary
            constituencies in Kerala. The constituency is home to the largest
            population of scheduled tribes in Kerala and significant population
            of religious minorities. Wayanad is also blessed with rich
            biodiversity and has attracted farmers, merchants and traders for
            hundreds of years. However, the constituency faces several
            challenges in its development trajectory. Wayanad district is the
            only aspirational district in Kerala. A difficult terrain, limited
            connectivity, fragile ecosystem and the adverse impact of climate
            change pose severe challenges to its development trajectory.

            Shri. Rahul Gandhi&apos;s term began with the devastating floods in
            2019. Two consecutive floods in 2018 and 2019 uprooted the lives and
            livelihoods of thousands of people. The MP organized relief
            materials for over 18,000 families and surveyed flood hit areas.
            Relief packages, cleaning kits etc. were distributed to thousands of
            flood affected households. He was instrumental in raising critical
            issues with the Central Government, including extending the
            moratorium on repayment of farm loans, urgent repair of road
            infrastructure and expansion of MGREGA. The MP continues to monitor
            post-flood rehabilitation efforts and engages with affected
            communities to rebuild their lives.

            Projects worth 4.61 crores have been sanctioned under MPLADS program
            for the year 2019-2021. Over 40 projects were recommended, before
            the MPLADS scheme was suspended abruptly for two years. Projects
            ranging from purchase of vehicle for community health care centre,
            equipment for computer lab and construction of Anganwadi centre
            (Samskarikanilayam) have been sanctioned. Medical equipment, PPEs,
            masks etc. worth Rs. 2.70 crores were procured for the fight against
            the COVID-19 pandemic under the MPLADS program.

            To bolster the efforts of the district administration during the
            lockdown, 50 thermal scanners, 20000 masks and 1000 liters of
            sanitizer were donated. 28,000 kgs rice and 5600 kgs of pulses were
            contributed to the community kitchens. Since a significant number of
            people with other health ailments, especially kidney and liver
            related conditions require assistance, a one-time medical assistance
            of Rs. 28 lakhs was announced to help 1000 needy patients. Further,
            assistance was provided to constituents stranded in different parts
            of the country during the lockdown.

            The people of Wayanad have several longstanding demands, including
            lifting the night traffic ban on NH-766, the construction of a
            government medical college in Wayanad district and the urgent
            completion of the Nanjangud-Nilambur railway line. Shri. Rahul
            Gandhi has taken up these demands with the respective Union
            Ministries and the State Government. He has also raised these issues
            in Parliament and continues to advocate for a feasible solution.
