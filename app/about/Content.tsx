              Through his life, Rahul Gandhi has always been the strongest
              proponent of politics of purpose. Over the years, he has lent his
              voice to a number of issues but has always remained focused on
              propagating non-violence, equality and justice. He has imbibed
              these virtues through a lifelong tryst with Indian politics and
              history and has developed a keen understanding of the Indian
              social fabric. Having experienced the pain of losing both his
              father and grandmother to acts of violence and hatred, Rahul
              Gandhi&nbsp; has always been a champion of Gandhian philosophies
              of ahimsa and truth.

              Born on 19 June 1970, Rahul Gandhi spent his early childhood
              between Delhi, the political center of India, and Dehradun, a town
              nestled in the valley between the Himalayas and Shivaliks. He
              began his undergraduate career at Delhi’s St. Stephen’s College
              before moving to Harvard University in the USA. In his second
              year, Rahul transferred to Rollins College in Florida due to
              security threats following his father’s, the late Prime Minister
              Rajiv Gandhi’s, assassination. Rahul Gandhi graduated with a
              Bachelor’s degree in 1994. The year after, he obtained his M. Phil
              from Trinity College, Cambridge.

              Rahul began his professional career with the Monitor Group, a
              management consulting firm based out of London - he was adamant on
              creating a professional career before joining politics. He soon
              returned to India and set up his own technology consultancy in
              Mumbai, where he led his team as the Director. The influence of
              his work in the management and technology sector is apparent in
              his political leanings. Rahul has always been a strong proponent
              of harnessing the scale and dexterity that technology can lend
              while amplifying the power of India’s greatest asset — her
              citizens.

              The call to serve our nation and to be an instrumental part of her
              growth came to Rahul Gandhi in 2004. He chose to stand from his
              father’s constituency and continue the legacy of serving the
              people of Amethi in Uttar Pradesh.

              Rahul won his first election with an overwhelming margin of
              2,90,853 votes — a testament to the faith placed by the people of
              his constituency in him. From the beginning, it was apparent that
              Rahul believed that our nation’s future lies with her people.
              Through the ebbs and flows of a decade-long political career,
              Rahul has held true to the very principles that won him the hearts
              of the people in his very first election.

              In 2013, Rahul Gandhi was elected as the Vice-President of the
              Congress Party. Within the Congress party, Rahul Gandhi played the
              key role of channeling the party along the lines of Congress’ core
              principles. He tirelessly worked to democratise the student wing
              and youth wing of the Congress party and ensured a breath of fresh
              air entered the grand old party by encouraging young leaders to
              take up leadership positions. His pivotal role in shaping the
              party along Congress’ core values over his political career earned
              him the post of President of the Congress Party in 2017. Under
              Rahul Gandhi’s guidance, the Congress Party has once again emerged
              as the voice of the nation.

              While he was President of the Opposition party, Rahul Gandhi
              played a key role in raising the demands of various stakeholders
              of the country. He championed the rights of the poor &amp; the
              marginalised. He led the battle against the ruling government on
              poorly implemented policies such as Demonetisation, Aadhar, GST
              and more.

              The vision of Rahul Gandhi and his strategy to fight the
              democratic battle with love and unity is what makes the Congress
              Party the true representative of a united India. Going forward, he
              aims to put these principles into action by creating systems that
              provide India’s citizens with the tools and opportunities they
              need to reach their full potential.

              In his current role as a Member of Parliament in the 17th Lok
              Sabha, he represents the constituency of Wayanad in Kerala. After
              leaving his position as President of the Congress party, he has
              put all his focus &amp; energy in representing the people of
              Wayanad &amp; taking on the government on a number of issues, like
              the undemocratic abrogation of Article 370 &amp; the violation of
              human rights by the government in Kashmir. He remains steadfast in
              his quest for truth, peace &amp; harmony for the people of India.
