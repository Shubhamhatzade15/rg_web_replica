        "key": "KEY ISSUES",

        "1": "Jobs and MSME",
        "11": "Every year 12 million young people enter our job market searching for a livelihood. A majority of these young individuals have a high school education or less and are desperately seeking a mechanism to transform their lives. It is the responsibility of the government to organise the state machinery in a manner that will best suit the needs of these Indians.",
        "12": "In terms of an economic vision that would invigorate job creation in India, the prudent decision would be to adopt the same measures as former Prime Minister, Dr. Manmohan Singh, but mould them to suit the current economic atmosphere. The Congress party has predominantly been adaptable towards the requirements of the time. Our policies have always been and will continue to be responsive to the needs of the people. The current and most prominent need is job creation and establishing the right political and financial infrastructure to help build our small and medium enterprises into global power houses.",
        "13": "We need to create a balanced labour policy to promote growth and productivity while simultaneously providing security, remunerative wages and a quick justice system for the labour. Thereby protecting contract labour from exploitation and ensuring strict implementation of “equal work - equal pay” provisions. Our focus has always been to protect the weaker sections of society and ensure their upliftment, a unified labour policy will not only protect our citizens but ensure a stronger and more prosperous economy. However, in order for our economy to grow, creating new jobs is the need of the hour. We need to create sector specific jobs to encourage growth in both urban and rural areas. It is imperative we take all the necessary steps for job expansion in the organised and unorganised sector by boosting domestic consumption, putting exports on a high growth trajectory, and focusing on Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises (MSMEs) as our mechanisms of growth.",
        "14": "The current state of the political and economic structure predominantly favours large corporations, they&apso;re monopolising the banking system, while MSMEs struggle to get minor bank loans. Since MSMEs constitute a large chunk of our economy our focus needs to aggressively change towards prioritising ease of doing business for them, and as a result create new jobs. Unlike China, our democratic system does not allow us to create large fear ridden factories, hence our focus needs to be on helping smaller businesses achieve global excellence. India's real innovative strength lies with millions of small firms and young entrepreneurs; therefore, it is imperative we carve out a space for MSMEs to prosper in our economy. We need to bring in experts from around the globe to help us turn these small and medium companies into multinational companies.",
        "15": "The conversation in India, when it comes to the economy is always about growth, and while growth is important it fast becomes meaningless if it doesn't also create jobs. In order for our economy to flourish and our people to flourish, our focus needs to dramatically change towards creating millions of new jobs, to empowering the labour, and to providing a conducive environment for MSMEs to grow.",

        "2" : "Agriculture",
        "21": "“Everything can wait, but not agriculture,” said Pandit Nehru many decades ago, but the same holds true even today. Agriculture is the building block of our economy, and farmers are the foundation. Under no circumstance can we take them for granted or ignore their plight. Due to the current state of the economy and political structure, farmer suicides have reached staggering rates, primarily due to mounting indebtedness, non-remunerative prices for their crops, increasing cost of production, and declining agriculture credit. The Congress party and I strongly believe in the importance of setting up state machinery that works to benefit farmers and their families.",
        "22": "Our primary focus must remain on helping Indian farmers escape the shackles of mounting debt, we have to focus our efforts on finding innovative and sustainable measures to remove this burden. In order to help everyone, we will initiate a loan waiver scheme for small and marginal farmers, on the same lines as the farm loan waiver programme devised by the UPA government in 2009, which benefitted over 3.2 crore farmers. In addition, it is imperative for farmers to receive state support on the price of their produce. We need to relook at the current MSP, and incorporate the formula suggested by the Swaminathan Committee. We must take into consideration the value of owned capital assets, rent paid for leased-in land, and the rental of owned land. Without the proper MSP calculation, we are doing our farmers a disservice and will never be able to provide them the support they need.",
        "23": "In order to help farmers grow, we need to create the right opportunities, that will benefit them in the most substantial manner. We must provide interest free loans to cover input costs to tenant farmers, share-croppers, and farmers that own and cultivate up to two hectares of land. This will ensure they are provided the platform they need to improve yield, without the worry of finances. In addition, we need a farmer centric paradigm shift in Indian agriculture that will restore profitability, taking a humanitarian and compassionate approach to enhance farmers' incomes, ensuring dignity to farmers, good education to their children, healthcare to their families and financial and social security through pensions to farmers and farm workers. The Kisan and Krishi Majdoor Welfare Aayog, will oversee welfare for farmers and farm workers, guaranteeing them social security through a pension fund.",
        "24": "In every sector of our economy, including agriculture, we need to consider innovative, scientific and modern methods to achieve better results. The Congress party has always been of the belief that every Indian must benefit from modern technology and scientific discovery. For agriculture we will extend support to start-ups and businesses in the farming sector to assist farmers with marketing, new technology, distribution, etc. We will explore setting up Special Agricultural Zones which would focus on raising high value crops for the domestic and export markets. This will lead to branding of products, economies of scale and attract investments, benefiting farmers irrespective of their background. We will focus on creating skill centres for farmers at the block level - much like former Congress CM, Siddaramaiah did in Karnataka - to ensure farmers have access to the latest technology and networks. We will also emphasise imparting basic skills in agriculture and animal husbandry at class VIII level so that students can understand the significance of agriculture.",
        "25": "In a country where 56% of the working population belongs to the agriculture and allied sectors, it is imperative that we frame our policies to benefit those people. 60 years ago, India became a food surplus nation through modern technology adopted in the Green Revolution; today we must strive to create a radical change similar to early 1960s and completely transform the lives of farmers and their families.",

        "3" : "Land Acquisition Bill",
        "31": "Is economic growth and social equity mutually exclusive? This is one of the most pertinent questions of our time. While infrastructural development and monetary growth are important for our country, it cannot be at the cost of the people, it cannot be at the cost of the farmers, and it cannot be at the cost of the poor. The Land Acquisition Rehabilitation and Resettlement Act 2013 (LARR), is designed to protect the farmers and the poor from exploitation by rich corporates and public private partnerships. It is our belief that we must enforce this Act and ensure it is implemented to the true letter of the law.",
        "32": "As it stands today, the state is guilty of possessing significant land banks acquired for either public or social purposes, that remain completely unused. The loss to farmers' capital appreciation is immense - especially in the last decade when India's economy was booming. The 2013 Land Act - implemented by the UPA - provides for the return of un-utilised acquired land, within a period of five years. The LARR Act was purposefully constructed as pro-farmer, not pro-corporate - following the UPA's legacy of pro-farmer land acquisition policies. The process for land acquisition under the Act involves a Social Impact Assessment Survey that offers a series of checks and balances prior to allowing the land to be acquired. For instance, there must be a preliminary notification stating intent for acquisition, compensation has to be given by a predetermined date, and rehabilitation and resettlement must be provided to the affected persons.",
        "33": "In terms of the compensation, the UPA government insisted on fair compensation for both rural and urban areas, hence for rural areas the rate must be four times that of the market price and two times for urban areas. In such cases where the land is being acquired by private companies or in the cases of Public Private Partnerships, the organisation must receive consent from 80% of the displaced people. In these cases, the corporate must also provide rehabilitation and resettlement to the displaced peoples. The Act was designed in a manner that would make land acquisition both fair and equitable, it benefits the farmers immensely and ensures their land cannot be acquired without their consent - this should apply even in cases when the farmer is unable to repay loans, their land is theirs and the government must find alternate methods to recover the loan.",
        "34": "In a country where 70% of the population lives in rural areas, the LARR is incredibly important, especially to safeguard people from losing what is rightfully theirs. The benefits of LARR is for the poor, for the farmers and for the marginalised. The fight that it took to pass the LARR Bill was completely worth the effort because the people that will reap these benefits are the people who need it most, the people that the Congress will never leave behind, the people that helped build this nation and the people that will do so long after we are gone.",
        
        "4": "Women Empowerment",
        "41": "Women hold up half of this nation, and have an equal claim to decision-making.",
        "42": "Today, we have inspiring role models in every field - from ISRO scientists to athletes. But we need to do so much more to end the bias that sets in right at birth, and deprives women of their share in nutrition, healthcare, education, employment, resources and life-chances. The Congress party and I are determined to do everything we can to make this possible.",
        "43": "Statistics about violence against women are often bandied about, but we need to work on the solutions, with urgency. We must care about women's safety and security, and we must care about their freedom. They are citizens who must have an economic, political and social voice - as guaranteed by the Constitution of India.",
        "44": "It was a Congress government that introduced gender budgeting, and our policies like MNREGA have kept women in mind at every step - be it equal wages, involvement in audits, and direct payment into bank accounts. Every action that helps women is our cause, like our recent successful campaign to end GST on sanitary pads.",
        "45": "Indian women, whatever their other social identities, deserve equal rights in inheritance, marriage, separation, spousal support and so on. We are committed to this cause. Along with economic empowerment, it is pertinent that our country demands equal political representation of women. While panchayats in many states have 50 percent reservation for women, they are still shamefully under-represented in state assemblies and Parliament. Only 11 percent of seats are occupied by women currently, and this must change. The Congress championed the women's reservation bill in Parliament, and passed it in the Rajya Sabha, but, unfortunately, it lapsed. We offer our wholehearted support to its passage. We need women to frame policy, to strengthen party organisations, and to lead us to a fairer future.",

        "5": "Right To Information",
        "51": "India's greatest asset has always been its people. From our brilliant scientists who are taking this nation to new frontiers in the universe to the farmers and workers who keep this nation running with their ceaseless toil, our people are our greatest assets. We are on the brink of a new age of success and it is our quintessentially Indian work ethic, our special talent for handling adversities, and our ability to come together for a united purpose that will make us achieve greatness.",
        "52": "It is these people that our party and I work for. Since its inception, the Indian National Congress' goal has been to ease the path of Indians seeking to achieve their potential by removing roadblocks and creating opportunities. It is this single-minded drive that pushed us to enact the Right to Information (RTI) Act in the year 2005, that would empower the citizens of our country.",
        "53": "In this increasingly globalised world, the maxim “Information is power” has never been truer. Our goal with the Right to Information Act was to transfer power back to its natural bearers — the citizens of our country. Information that had been secreted away in government offices, lost amongst files, or just been forgotten is now freely available to any Indian who asks for it. In the hands of the common man, this is a tool that is used to ensure that the system does not become a machine they are merely a cog in. It is a tool by which they stand for what is right. It is a tool that powers everyone's progress by keeping everyone accountable to their constituents and fellow citizens.",
        "54": "This revolutionary law was not borne out of fear. The Indian National Congress was proactive in pushing through the Right to Information Act because of the principles we have been founded on and continue to uphold. Despite detractors who feared exposure and misuse, we championed this Act because it represented an inalienable right that people held, and they just needed a channel to exercise it. We did this despite knowing the scrutiny it would put our own government and its allies under because, very simply, it was the right thing to do.",
        "55": "The citizens we were aiming to serve did not disappoint us. The Act has been used to protect the rights of vulnerable groups, to do a deep dive into government office functioning and funding. But no information is frivolous since it empowers the common people to hold their public servants accountable. It gives them the right to question the government. The Congress, like the nation it serves, has always been by the people, for the people, and of the people. The Right to Information Act was just one more example which proves that.",

        "6": "Net Neutrality",
        "61": "Tim Berners-Lee, the man who invented the world wide web, could have been a very rich man today. Instead, he works as a professor at the University of Oxford and champions open data initiatives worldwide. Why would this man choose to give away a piece of work that he slaved over for years, for free? It is because he believed the internet, and the information it empowered us with, was for everyone.",
        "62": "The internet was created with democratic intent for a reason - because the information it gives us helps Davids take on Goliaths. No man or woman is too weak, poor, unresourced, or incapable with the right information in their hands. It is using this platform that justice can be brought even to the weakest sections of our society.",
        "63": "For the Congress & myself, net neutrality is a must, we believe all Internet Service Providers, Telecom Service Providers & the government should treat all data on the internet equally. People should be free to visit any website they want thereby enabling a level playing field. It is imperative that schemes like Digital India do not become a euphemism for an internet controlled by large remote corporations. It is important that we recognise the danger in privileging a private platform over a public internet - this would inevitably lead to a digital divide.",
        "64": "We do not believe in controlling the information people consume, nor do we believe in censoring their debate or dialogue. The internet is platform of equality, it was created as space where all individuals have equal access to all parts of it - hence net neutrality should be a prerequisite, not a luxury. An open internet enables equitable access for everyone, it prevents unfair & discriminatory pricing practices, it promotes innovations & most importantly it ensures the protection of freedom of speech. Net neutrality is imperative for India to grow in the 21st century. Information is power and this power belongs in the hands of all citizens.",

        "7": "Dalit Rights",
        "71": "The caste system is not just a historical shame that divided Indians and trapped our potential, we are still struggling to get out of its dark shadow. Equality and social justice, were the promises of Dr. B. R. Ambedkar's Constitution, but even today, the persistence of caste blights many lives.",
        "72": "Rohith Vemula, a Dalit PhD scholar in Hyderabad University, was driven to suicide, for speaking against a world, where the value of a man was reduced to his immediate identity and nearest possibility - to a vote, to a number, to a thing. Never was a man treated as a mind. I can only quote Rohit Vemula's vision of a world where human beings can be truly valued 'as glorious things made up of stardust, in every field, in studies, in streets, in life and in death'.",
        "73": "In a hierarchical context, achieving equality takes an extra effort. Right from universal adult suffrage, the Congress party has aimed to establish the equal worth of every individual, and to combat social discrimination. Land distribution, expanding access to education and employment through reservations, boosting and supporting Dalit voices in politics, are a part of this effort.",
        "74": "Caste is a denial of equal opportunity, and we have tried to widen possibilities for Dalits at every chance we get. Dalits still face higher barriers at every level of education; they often lack the strong networks needed for entrepreneurship. To take one example of our efforts to correct this, it was a Congress government that mandated a part of government procurement from Dalit businesses, in small and medium enterprises.",
        "75": "Achieving one's potential is possible only when one is free from threat and discrimination. It was Congress leadership that announced the Prevention of Atrocities Act to combat caste-based crimes, and it was a Congress government that reserved seats for SC/ST citizens in panchayats and as panchayat heads. Making these rights real, and defending them from the socially powerful, is an ongoing effort. Dalit women, in particular, face a double challenge. But this struggle is one that I am wholly committed to, as is the Congress party.",
        "76": "We will raise our voices at any attempt to constrict Dalit dignity and power, whether on a campus, a workplace, or in the streets.",

        "8": "Adivasi Rights",
        "81": "70 years ago India took several steps to transform itself from a colonised state to a free and independent nation. This transformation required every citizen to take great risk in some manner or the other. Today, 72 years after Independence we are reaping the benefits of the hard work and sacrifice. It is my belief and the belief of the Congress party that since every Indian shared the risk, they must also share the reward. It is the right of every Indian to have equal access, opportunity and freedom - no matter creed, caste or tribe. What makes India unique and what makes it strong is the wonderful diversity of our people and our cultures. We need to protect this diversity and ensure it continues to shine.",
        "82": "In order to achieve this, we need to ensure the protection of every citizen. The Adivasi's of our country have the right to live freely, without fear of harm, of eviction, of displacement with no notice at the whims and fancies of a chosen few. The governmen's role is to protect these rights and to ease their way to achieving more for their families and communities.",
        "83": "It is the responsibility of the government machinery to provide proper and specialised representation to the Adivasis. We believe in the need to set up a targeted tribal affairs department - besides the Scheduled Caste department - that will have the sole purpose of protecting Adivasi interests. Through such a department we need to implement methods to protect their land and ensure it is not misused by other interested stakeholders. In cases where obtaining forest land is necessary for mining, we must create a mechanism that makes Adivasis shareholders in development.",
        "84": "I am of the view that we have much to learn from these communities. The Adivasis of our nation understand one of our greatest natural resources — our forests — much better than others would. They have lived in and learned from our forests a lesson that the rest of the world has just started to realise — how to live harmoniously with nature. These communities need resources to sustain and grow themselves, not to be ill-treated and talked down to.",
        "85": "We strongly believe it is imperative to ensure the Forest Right Act is implemented to the letter of the law. The Act grants legal recognition to traditional forest dwelling communities, correcting the injustice caused by previous forest laws. It gives these communities a voice in forest and wildlife conservation and clearly designates what constitutes a forest dwelling Scheduled Tribe. This is vital for distributing land and land rights. Under the law even if the tribe doesn't have the proper paperwork to prove the land belongs to them, they can have access to 4 hectares of land so long as they cultivating it on their own. The land cannot be sold or transferred to anyone except through inheritance. Most importantly, the law gives the right to protect and conserve forest land to the community. This is vital for thousands of village communities who are protecting the forest and wildlife against threats from forest mafias, industries and land grabbers.",
        "86": "In honour of our Constitution, we believe it is imperative that all individuals are treated equally. We must empower Adivasi's — especially Adivasi youth — by promoting developmental schemes, skill building workshops, and access to platforms that promote knowledge sharing. We must ensure they are given the same opportunities and access as the majority of Indians get.",
        "87": "Every citizen of this nation has the right to live freely and fully in the journey to achieving their dreams. We are not a nation that can claim to be fully free until every citizen is empowered — not just a few, not almost everyone, but every single one. This especially holds true for the most marginalised in our country. If we are unable to protect and empower our most vulnerable people, can we truly claim to be a just and equitable society that gives everyone a chance to succeed?",

        "9": "National Rural Employment Guarantee Act",
        "91": "India is not a nation of freeloaders. We wrested our freedom from the British through pure tenacity and it is this very tenacity that runs in our blood to this very day. Our farmers, labourers, artisans, craftsmen, and the rest of the working class are a classic example of this. Our greatest strength has been our labour force that is willing to work hard, work sincerely, and work well every single day. It was this rock-solid work ethic that NREGA - a program the World Bank calls “a stellar example of rural development” - tapped into. People were suffering not due to a lack of skill or fear of hard work, but a lack of opportunity to do so. So, in 2005, we developed a scheme to remove this barrier and demonstrate the Congress's approach towards social welfare.",
        "92": "NREGA represents the Congress's commitment to a decentralised policy structure by allowing the Panchayati system to implement the policy specifics. It also personifies our bottom up approach to policy making - NREGA was implemented after a Congress worker presented his findings of a smaller scale NREGA style policy that was carried out in his district. NREGA has been created to provide the people with a fundamental right - the right to work and to provide for themselves, their families and escape the clutches of poverty.",
        "93": "We placed our faith in our fellow Indians, and they have not let us down. Since its inception, NREGA has had a transformational impact on our rural economy. Every year, this scheme has provided employment to over 5 crore households, on average. The average wage earned by a citizen for a day's work has gone up by 81%. Marginalised communities have benefited - women account for 47% and those from the SC and ST communities for 51% of total person-days of work generated- well above the 33% baseline standard we set for ourselves.",
        "94": "The scheme has worked due to two reasons - our faith in the grit and determination of Indians and because we put our money where our mouth is. We invested Rs. 35,000 crore in our people, offering them opportunities to earn an honest living. As we expected, they turned out in record numbers to do so. to.",
        "95": "WA recent Brookings report revealed India no longer holds the dubious distinction of being home to the largest number of poor people and has moved down in the global poverty rankings. The report credits this achievement to the foresight of former PM Dr. Manmohan Singh and his economic policies that helped the India experience rapid growth between 2004 and 2011. It also credits the massive reduction of poverty to NREGA, which has prevented over 14 crore Indians from falling into a life of poverty and reduced poverty by 32%.",
        "96": "Our country is on the precipice of achieving unimaginable success and there is plenty of work to be done - NREGA, too, must evolve with the people it serves. The Congress party since its inception has evolved with the changing times and the changing needs of the people. Today our greatest need is to create a jobs for our growing working population and NREGA, is one means to fulfil that need.",

        "10": "Goods and Services Tax",
        "101": "The Goods and Services Tax was first introduced during the UPA II government in 2011, as a Constitutional Amendment. The idea was to create a single tax for the country that would subsume CENVAT, CVD, SAD, VAT and state taxes; it is a single levy at the final point of consumption. The Bill gave Central and State governments concurrent powers to introduce laws on taxation of goods and services. GST was designed to make business easier for the market and cost of living cheaper for the common man.",
        "102": "The attributes of the GST proposed by the Congress party are simple - there would only be a single slab and there would be a cap of 18%. Goods and services consumed by weaker sections of society would be left out of the tax ambit, thereby improving their quality of life and reducing cost of living. It is imperative to cap the tax at 18% so as to ensure state governments will not attempt to lobby for extra taxes over and above GST. We will also bring petrol, diesel and natural gas in the ambit of GST so as to save the common man from the burden of increasing fuel prices.",
        "103": "The Bill also provided for the creation of a GST Dispute Settlement Authority that was able to adjudicate disputes between central and state governments which had the potential to result in loss of revenue or affect the harmonised tax structure. It also ensures there would be no additional levy of 1% on supply of goods over and above GST. Since the tax is levied at point of consumption, 1% levy will create distortions in the tax structure. This has been pointed out by several economists who argue that there is no point in implementing GST with an additional levy.",
        "104": "The current GST with five tax slabs and a cap at 28% makes for an extremely complicated tax structure. An abundance of tax slabs makes corruption more likely and directly affects the functioning of MSMEs. We need a system whereby the state machinery is working in the best interest of the people, ensuring ease of doing business and improving the quality of life for every citizen."
